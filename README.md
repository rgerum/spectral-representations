# Different Spectral Representations in Optimized Artificial Neural Networks and Brains

This repository is the official implementation of [Different Spectral Representations in Optimized Artificial Neural Networks and Brains](https://arxiv.org/...). 

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training

To train the models in the paper, run the script in the training folder:

```train
python run.py
```

It will execute the code in train.py with all the hyperparameters that were used in the paper.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the data and create the figures for the paper run the scripts figure1.py, figure2.py, ... in the evaluation folder.
